# Packages {#packages}

This is a starter template for creating a beautiful, customizable documentation site for your project with minimal effort. You’ll only have to change a few settings and you’re ready to go.

### [laraveleg\options](/docs/package-options)
You can create options, reuse them and rely on them at a later time. Inspired by the [WordPress](https://codex.wordpress.org/Options_API) system and built on the `Laravel` framework.
### [laraveleg\user-online](/docs/package-user-online)
Define the status of the user that was online or otherwise.
